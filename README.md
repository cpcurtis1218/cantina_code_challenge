### Cantina Code Challenge

This is my attempt at Cantina's code challenge.

- To test the program, please clone this repo and cd into the directory.
- From the terminal run: node code_challenge.js
- You will be prompted to input a selector

The main issue I'm having at this time is to get the 'subviews' to function properly.
Currently, the program is not recursive when the input is subviews as I am getting a
RangeError.
